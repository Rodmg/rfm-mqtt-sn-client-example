# rfm-mqtt-sn-client-example

An example of an Aquila 2.0 MQTT-SN client implementation for RFM69 (915Mhz) module with ATmega328p microcontroller, designed to work with [Aquila MQTT-SN Gateway](https://github.com/Rodmg/aquila-mqtt-sn-gateway).

## Requirements

For compiling and uploading this code to the board you need the PlatformIO tools and the [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/get-started).

## Using

First, clone this repo **with all its submodules**:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rodmg/rfm-mqtt-sn-client-example.git
```

Open the project folder from the Atom IDE with PlatformIO IDE plugin installed, connect your board and press the upload button.

Right now the project is configured to work on an Arduino nano with ATmega328 or equivalent, that has the RFM69 connected via SPI the standard way that the [RadioHead library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) recommends.

The code has been tested with the 915Mhz version of the RFM69C module.

## Customizing and understanding the code

Read and edit ``src/main.ino``. I hope the comments are enough for understanding the basic MQTT-SN functionality.
